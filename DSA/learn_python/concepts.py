iterator Vs iterable?
-->consider a book
    no. of pages in book can be iterate
        -->is iterable--->lists, dict, tuple, set, array
            -->produces an iterator
    bookmark in book
        -->is iterator
        --->it tells/gives us obj where it is exactly while iterating over iterable
        -->used in generators
        -->it can be any value which produces stream of values
        -->only operation in iterators is next()
iterator = iter(iterable) # or iterable.__iter__()
value = next(iterator)  # or iterator.next() or iterator.__next__()
value = next(iterator)
...




Abstract and customize your iterations!
See how you can use more generators and __iter__ method in your code

what is xrange?--->it is an obj which is iterator

How to approach modifying list while iterating over it?
-->best approach would be to create new list
-->There is problem if we are iterating over list from starting and remove any ele
    -->It will miss next element while it traverse
        --suppose it is at 4th ele and if we delete it
            -->then 5th will come to 4th place
                -->so it is missed in next iteration
-->other hack is to travers list from back and modify it if required
